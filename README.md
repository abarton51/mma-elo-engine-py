# MMA ELO Engine

## Introduction
The MMA ELO Engine is a powerful tool designed to answer the age-old question: "Who is the best fighter?" In the world of mixed martial arts (MMA), rankings can often be subjective and hotly debated. Our project leverages the ELO rating system, traditionally used in chess, to objectively evaluate fighters' performance based on head-to-head contests. By scraping data from various MMA organizations, we calculate ELO scores that provide a quantifiable measure of a fighter's skill level. This engine not only aids in ranking fighters but also fuels discussions about their abilities, making the conversation about "the best" more data-driven and insightful.

## Technical Overview

### Design Philosophy
The MMA ELO Engine was designed with the following principles in mind:
- **Data-Driven Insights**: By utilizing a proven statistical framework, our project aims to provide an objective ranking system that transcends subjective opinions.
- **Modularity and Scalability**: The architecture allows for easy addition of new data sources and methods for calculating ELO scores, ensuring that the engine can adapt to changes in the MMA landscape.

### Technology Stack
- **Database**: PostgreSQL is used to store fighter data, fight results, and calculated ELO scores, ensuring data integrity and efficient querying.
- **Web Scraping**: We utilize Python libraries like Beautiful Soup and Scrapy to gather statistics from multiple MMA organizations, enabling comprehensive data collection.
- **API Development**: FastAPI is employed to create a robust and high-performance API, allowing users to access fighter statistics and ELO scores programmatically.
- **Data Processing**: Custom algorithms are implemented to calculate ELO scores based on fight outcomes, adjusting ratings according to the opponents' ranks.

### Architecture
The project is structured in a modular fashion:
1. **Data Collection**: A web scraper fetches and stores fighter statistics and fight results in the database.
2. **ELO Calculation**: An ELO calculation module processes fight results and updates fighter ratings accordingly.
3. **API Layer**: The FastAPI application serves as an interface for users to query fighters and their ELO scores, facilitating easy access to data.

### Unique Features
What sets the MMA ELO Engine apart from existing UFC/MMA ELO projects:
- **Dynamic Data Sources**: Our system integrates data from various MMA promotions, providing a more comprehensive view of a fighter's performance.
- **Real-Time Updates**: As fights occur, the engine automatically updates fighter ratings, ensuring that users always have access to the most current data.
- **User-Friendly API**: The FastAPI interface allows developers and enthusiasts to easily access and integrate the ELO data into their applications or analyses.

## Data Flow

The data flow in this project can be summarized as follows:

1. **Scraping**: The backend utilizes Scrapy to scrape data from various MMA-related websites. The data collected includes information about fighters, fights, and events.

2. **Processing**: After the data is scraped, it is processed and cleaned to ensure it adheres to the required schema.

3. **Storing**: The processed data is then stored in a PostgreSQL database named `mma_elo_db`, which consists of the following tables:
   - **Fighters**: Contains information about each fighter.
   - **Fights**: Records details about each fight, including the fighters involved and the result.
   - **Events**: Details about the events where the fights take place.

4. **API Interaction**: The backend exposes API endpoints that allow users to query the database and retrieve information about fighters, fights, and events. Users can perform actions such as:
   - Fetching fighter statistics.
   - Retrieving fight history.
   - Accessing event details.

## Conclusion
The MMA ELO Engine is not just a ranking system; itâ€™s a step towards a more analytical approach to understanding fighter performance in mixed martial arts. By combining the ELO rating system with modern data collection and API technologies, this project aims to bring clarity to the conversation about who truly deserves the title of "the best fighter."
